# Exercise-1
My first repository

Hello, World! 

  My name is Rafael, I'm  from Brazil and I work as an Art Director and Graphic Designer in a advertising agency. 
  
    A few days ago I started my studies in the code's world, and now I'm creating my first repository. 
    
    Here we have my first exercise to test my skills with HTML5 and CSS3.
